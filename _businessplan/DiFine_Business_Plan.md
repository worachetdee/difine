# DiFine Business Plan

## Executive Summary

## Business Profile

### Product/Service Description

DiFine is a monthly luxury dining subscription. Members are invited to exceptional restaurants, and the cost of the dinner course is included. Designed for affluent, busy professionals in Tokyo, DiFine provides access to fine dining without the hassle of the traditional reservation process.

### Starting Point

Time spent at a premium restaurant is a true escape from the daily grind. Enjoying signature dishes prepared by Michelin-starred chefs and vintage wines selected by sommeliers, while surrounded by first-class service and elegant furnishings, fills our hearts through all five senses.

However, the journey to securing a table is far from luxurious. Tokyo has over 130,000 restaurants (Tabelog 2025), with more than 500 listed in the Michelin Guide (Michelin Guide 2026). Diners will explore various gourmet websites, check reviews on social media, and locate restaurants on Google Maps. Then comes registering on reservation sites, filling out forms, or making direct phone calls. Imagine their frustration when the phone doesn't connect, or their desired date is fully booked.

### Our Approach

DiFine will handle it all. This unique service lets diners enjoy the pure dining experience without these hassles. Our matching algorithm learns subscribers' tastes and schedules, inviting them to special dinner courses every month—from famous French restaurants to innovative fusion cuisine, or Japanese traditionals. The cost of the dinner course is included in the subscription, so members only need to pay for their drinks.

DiFine also serves as a strong partner for restaurant owners. Partner restaurants can expect a steady stream of customers through our service. Open seats are automatically assigned to members, which improves restaurant utilization rates. Unlike free reservation sites, our members are affluent food enthusiasts who pay premium membership fees and have high upselling potential. Our cancellation policy provides full compensation for the course fee in the event of a no-show.

## Company Description

Based in Asia, we aim to capture growth in the expanding luxury market. We offer a subscription model that provides affluent individuals with curated, exclusive dining experiences. Our business model is scalable because we don't own restaurants, but rather provide a platform that matches diners with tables.

### Mission

We eliminate all the hassles of restaurant reservations and invite foodies in Asia to exclusive dining experiences on a regular basis.

### Vision

We are not a reservation service provider. Rather, we are a hospitality company that provides tech-enabled luxury dining experiences.

We believe that dishes prepared by top chefs enrich people's lives, just as music from renowned orchestras and artworks by master artists do. We envision that a fine dining experience should be luxurious not only during the mealtime, but also throughout the entire journey, from selecting the restaurant to arriving at the table, and all the way back home.

### Values

Our core values are **exclusivity**, **hospitality**, and **simplicity**.

- **Exclusivity:** We are committed to providing exclusive luxury experiences unavailable on other platforms, not merely redistributing restaurant seating.
- **Hospitality:** Also known as "Omotenashi" in Japanese, it reflects our commitment to going above and beyond to ensure our customers' satisfaction.
- **Simplicity:** We eliminate the hassle of luxury dining reservations, allowing customers to focus solely on the luxury experience.

### Objectives

Our business originates in Tokyo, the city with the world's highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants (Near+Far 2025) and the third-largest affluent population globally (Henley & Partners 2025).

We will launch our business with funding from angel investors and venture capitalists, aiming to achieve profitability within our third year.

After confirming product-market fit, we will secure Series A funding and expand our operations to other major Asian cities like Singapore and Hong Kong.

### Partners

Restaurants are our invaluable partners, not just suppliers. In the first year, we aim to secure contracts with 25 restaurants, primarily Michelin-listed restaurants in Tokyo. This number represents 5% of Michelin-listed restaurants in Tokyo (approximately 500, including Bib Gourmand and Selected). In the second year, we will expand our partner base to 50, and to 100 in the third year. Concurrently, we will secure opportunities for exclusive luxury experiences unavailable on other platforms, such as special courses and events featuring renowned chefs.

Additionally, we will contract APIs from Amex, Visa, and Mastercard to improve our matching algorithm. Only when customers explicitly consent, DiFine will fetch payment histories via APIs to learn customer purchasing behavior and restaurant visits, thereby inviting them to restaurants better aligned with their preferences.

We will also develop API integration with third-party reservation management systems and restaurant booking sites (such as TableCheck) already implemented by restaurants to synchronize real-time seat availability.

## Industry Background

### Luxury Dining and Hospitality

By providing a luxury dining subscription for affluent individuals, our business is rooted in the luxury dining industry. While there is no universal definition of fine dining, it is often characterized by its high price. According to research by Chef's Pencil, the median dining cost at Michelin starred restaurants in Tokyo was USD 209 (Chef's Pencil 2024).

However, viewing our business through a single industry is not adequate. In terms of providing experiences, we compete with other luxury services, such as luxury travel and cruises. By arranging curated dining experiences, we may also compete with concierge services. Although the term "luxury hospitality" typically refers to high-end hotels and resorts, it aptly describes how our business values the entire dining experience, rather than the meal itself.

### Industry Outlook

An annual Luxury Study by Bain & Company and Altagamma forecasts accelerated growth in the luxury industry (D'Arpizio et al. 2025). Global spending in the luxury industry reached EUR 1.44 trillion, increasing by 12% to 14% from 2019, with a CAGR of 2%. The report projects total spending will reach EUR 2.2 to 2.7 trillion by 2035, with a CAGR of 4% to 6%.

Out of the total luxury spending, luxury experience spending (luxury hospitality, fine dining, and cruises) accounts for 20%, amounting to approximately EUR 290 billion. This sector has shown a higher growth rate than that of luxury personal goods and experience-based goods since 2010, excluding the COVID-19 period. The luxury hospitality spending has grown by 21-23%, and gourmet food and fine dining spending grew by 39-41% from 2019 to 2025 (D'Arpizio et al. 2025).

Although fine dining has shown a higher growth rate than luxury hospitality in recent years, luxury hospitality remains a massive market, approximately eight times larger than fine dining (D'Arpizio et al. 2025). By positioning fine dining as a more accessible hospitality experience than travel, our business will benefit from both the high-end restaurant industry and the luxury hospitality industry.

### Regional Outlook

Regionally, the three primary markets in the luxury industry are Europe, the Americas, and APAC, each accounting for about one-third of global luxury consumption (D'Arpizio et al. 2025).

Tokyo's nominal GDP for fiscal year 2022 was JPY 120.2 trillion (Cabinet Office Japan 2025). Converted at an exchange rate of JPY 130 per USD, this represents approximately 0.90% of the world's total nominal GDP in 2022 (IMF 2025). Since the global luxury dining market is valued at EUR 32 billion (D'Arpizio et al. 2025), Tokyo's luxury dining market is estimated to be about EUR 0.29 billion. Likewise, Tokyo's luxury hospitality market is estimated to be approximately EUR 2.26 billion.

### Competition

Our service is so unique that no competitors offer identical services. However, several substitute services can be considered:

1. **Restaurant reservation platforms** can serve as substitutes for customers who don't mind booking restaurants themselves. As of December 2025, 74% of the Michelin-listed restaurants in Tokyo can be booked through Michelin-partnered services such as Omakase, TableCheck, and Mozrest.

2. **Existing luxury services** can serve as alternatives for customers not committed to regularly enjoying fine dining. Platinum credit cards, hotel elite programs, and membership clubs offer exclusive events, such as premium tours, cruises, concerts, sports viewing, and golf.

### Barriers to Entry

There are mainly five barriers to entry:

1. **Trust is key to partnerships with high-end restaurants.** Popular restaurants may be reluctant to partner with new services that lack credibility. DiFine's customer base consists of true foodies who are willing to pay a monthly fee, presenting opportunities for upselling and becoming loyal customers.

2. **Adding new reservation channels can be burdensome for restaurants.** DiFine will investigate the reservation management systems commonly used by restaurants and develop API integration with the major systems.

3. **Customers are locked into the existing luxury ecosystem.** DiFine is different from existing services—customers receive monthly invitations to new restaurants while still being able to book through other platforms.

4. **Building a luxury brand takes time.** DiFine will balance the number of members and partner restaurants to provide exclusive service and maintain a high-quality customer base through word-of-mouth and referral systems.

5. **The complexity of handling cancellations.** DiFine employs a push-based system. When cancellations occur, our service instantly adjusts the assignments behind the scenes to maintain a high fill rate.

## Competitive Analysis

The competitive environment for premium dining in Tokyo is sophisticated yet fragmented. It comprises reservation platforms, concierge services, exclusive gourmet clubs, discovery platforms, and indirect substitutes such as other luxury subscriptions. Each is addressing only a portion of the luxury dining journey. None offers a fully integrated, curated, subscription-based experience that simultaneously guarantees regular access for diners and optimizes demand predictability and revenue stability for restaurants. This fragmentation enables DiFine to define a distinct category: **luxury dining-as-a-service**.

### Direct Competitors

#### Reservation Platforms

Reservation platforms such as TableCheck and OMAKASE by GMO form the digital backbone of Tokyo's fine-dining ecosystem. TableCheck is used by several thousand restaurants globally and typically charges restaurants monthly SaaS fees in the range of ¥10,000–¥30,000 per location.

From the diner's perspective, these platforms are efficient but stressful. Customers must actively search, monitor openings, and compete for peak-time reservations, with no personalization or guarantee of success. From the restaurant's perspective, these platforms primarily solve administrative efficiency rather than demand quality.

**DiFine differs fundamentally** by shifting from customer-initiated booking to platform-initiated invitations. Diners no longer search or compete; they receive curated invitations with guaranteed seats.

#### Concierge Services

Luxury concierge services, including American Express Platinum and Centurion as well as five-star hotel concierges, serve hundreds of thousands of affluent cardholders globally.

However, concierge services are manual, relationship-driven, and inconsistent at scale. Dining access is only one small feature within a broader lifestyle offering.

**DiFine provides** similar exclusivity but with a scalable, data-driven model. Automated matching, predictable diner flow, and structured compensation mechanisms make the platform operationally attractive to restaurants.

#### Exclusive Gourmet Clubs

Tokyo hosts several private gourmet clubs and invitation-only dining communities, such as City Club of Tokyo, that organize chef-led events, private tastings, and limited-seat dining experiences.

While such clubs may offer personalization through human curation, personalization is generally informal and episodic rather than systematic. Access is not guaranteed on a recurring basis.

**DiFine combines** exclusivity with algorithmic personalization, guaranteed recurring access, and prepaid demand.

#### Discovery Platforms

Platforms such as Tabelog and Gurunavi dominate restaurant discovery through reviews and rankings. However, they do not address the core challenge of premium dining: securing reservations at elite restaurants.

**DiFine eliminates** search entirely, replacing it with curated invitations and guaranteed experiences.

### Indirect Competitors and Substitutes

Beyond dining-focused competitors, DiFine also competes indirectly with other subscription-based luxury experiences targeting the same discretionary spending pool: luxury travel clubs, private members' clubs, wine and spirits subscriptions, art and culture memberships, and wellness or lifestyle concierge services.

While these alternatives offer exclusivity and convenience, they are typically episodic or annual in nature. Fine dining is uniquely repeatable and social, embedded in both personal and professional routines.

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitors | Examples | Strengths | Weaknesses | How DiFine Differs |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Reservation Platforms | TableCheck, Omakase | Large networks, Real-time booking | Stressful, No personalization, No guaranteed access | Curated invitations, No booking required, Guaranteed dining |
| Concierge Services | Amex Platinum, Hotel Concierges | Prestige, Personal service | Manual, Inconsistent, Limited access | Automated matching, Scalable, Predictable reservations |
| Gourmet Clubs | Tokyo Gourmet Club | Unique, Rare events | Infrequent, Limited personalization | Monthly dining, Tailored matches |
| Discovery Platforms | Tabelog, Gurunavi | Comprehensive | No guarantee, Time-consuming research | Removes search entirely with curated invitations |

### Risk of Imitation and Strategic Defences

A key strategic risk for DiFine is imitation by well-capitalized incumbents such as OMAKASE by GMO. However, the defensibility of DiFine does not arise from any single feature, but from a system-level business model that integrates prepaid demand, push-based allocation, and recurring engagement.

Defensibility is reinforced through:
- **Proprietary matching algorithms** that continuously learn from diner preferences
- **UX/UI optimization** that eliminates search, competition, and decision fatigue
- **Recurring engagement** that creates two-sided switching costs
- **Brand positioning** as a hospitality experience rather than a reservation utility

## Market Analysis

### Target Location

Since all of the founding members of DiFine are from Asia, we plan to base our business operations there. Our plan is to first launch in Tokyo and then expand into other major Asian cities.

In 2023, Asher & Lyrici surveyed 150 cities worldwide and calculated the "Global Foodie Index" based on five criteria:
- Number of Michelin-listed restaurants
- Number of "World's Best Restaurants"
- Number of types of cuisines offered
- Cost of dining
- Number of restaurants per capita

According to the index, **Tokyo was the world's most foodie-friendly city**, surpassing Paris in second and New York in fourth. Furthermore, eight of the top ten cities were in Asia.

Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, and Hong Kong are the only cities classified as A-rank in both the number of Michelin-listed restaurants and the number of "World's Best Restaurants." Tokyo has the highest number of restaurants per capita of these four cities and boasts the largest population of millionaires (Henley & Partners 2025).

### Market Size

- **TAM (Total Available Market):** Japan's total foodservice market is JPY 24.15 trillion (approximately USD 172.5 billion)
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** Tokyo's premium dining segment, estimated between JPY 184.5 billion (USD 1.19 billion) and JPY 720 billion (USD 4.65 billion)
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** A limited number of high-value subscribers

The Michelin Guide lists 410 starred and selected restaurants in Tokyo. Additionally, Tabelog lists around 1,600 Tokyo restaurants with a dinner price point of JPY 20,000 or higher.

### Market Needs

Our target market consists of affluent individuals residing in the Tokyo metropolitan area who enjoy dining at premium restaurants at least once a month.

**Target Segment:** Diners who make reservations through standard channels and are interested in discovering new restaurants.

**Key Needs:**
- **New Discoveries:** They seek restaurants they couldn't find on their own or that are difficult to book
- **Minimal Effort:** Their goal is to enjoy a luxurious experience, not the hassle of making reservations
- **Exclusivity:** They take pride in being part of an exclusive group
- **Personalization:** They want to be treated as individuals, not just one of many customers
- **Schedule Flexibility:** For those enjoying active lifestyles, sudden schedule changes are common

## Marketing Plan

### Unique Selling Proposition

**Unlocking Tokyo's Most Coveted Seats: Guaranteed Access to the Unreachable.**

Our service provides exclusive access to fine dining experiences including restaurants that are otherwise nearly impossible to secure. We eliminate the stress and frustration of traditional reservation processes—such as competing for limited seat releases on public platforms or navigating complex booking forms.

### Positioning Statement

**Tech-Enabled Luxury Hospitality:** For affluent Tokyo professionals and expatriates who are dissatisfied with the competitive, stressful nature of high-end reservation platforms like Omakase or TableCheck, our product is a luxury hospitality subscription that offers curated, platform-initiated dining invitations. Unlike manual concierge services or standard booking sites, we offer a scalable, data-driven matching algorithm that ensures monthly access to elite dining. We prioritise "Omotenashi" (hospitality), ensuring that every step—from the initial invitation to the moment the member arrives at the table—is seamless and prestigious.

### Pricing Strategy

**Value-Based Pricing:** We utilize Value-Based Pricing to align membership costs with the Use Value (Utility) our members receive. For our core segments, value is derived from Scarcity Access and Transaction Fluidity.

**Sequential Skimming:** We initially set high price points to capture the Consumer Surplus from high-net-worth individuals and early adopters who prioritize status and guaranteed access to high-end restaurants.

## Financial Plan

### Capital Requirements

DiFine requires an initial equity investment of **USD 1.2 million** to fund platform development, early operating losses, and working capital during the launch and scale-up phase. The business is designed to be capital-efficient and asset-light, with no requirement for external debt in the base case.

### Use of Funds

|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | $1,758,462 | $4,579,615 | $8,914,985 |
| Gross Profit | $703,385 | $1,923,438 | $3,922,593 |

| Net Margin | -5% | 20% | 29% |
| Closing Cash | $853,385 | $1,696,823 | $4,259,416 |

### Key Financial Assumptions

**Revenue & Pricing:**
- Subscription-based revenue model with bundled premium dining experiences
- Average subscribers grow from 300 (2026) to 1,200 (2028)
- Monthly blended ARPU increases from USD 488 to USD 619, driven by price increases and higher-tier mix

**Cost of Revenue:**
- Dining costs decline from 58% to 54% of revenue, reflecting scale efficiencies
- Payment and API fees remain stable at 2% of revenue

**Operating Expenses:**
- Total operating expenses declined from 44% of revenue in 2026 to 13% in 2028, enabling strong operating leverage

### Break-even Analysis

- **Estimated break-even revenue:** USD 2.2–2.4 million
- **Corresponding subscriber base:** ~400–450 subscribers

This is well below the projected 700 subscribers in 2027, providing a margin of safety.

### Risk & Reward Analysis

**Key Risks:**
- Slower subscriber acquisition
- Dining cost inflation
- Execution and service-quality risk

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Prepaid subscriptions improve cash visibility
- Variable cost structure allows rapid adjustment
- Controlled hiring and marketing spend preserve flexibility

**Reward Profile:**
- High operating leverage
- Recurring subscription revenue
- Strong cash generation and premium brand positioning

### Exit Strategy

DiFine targets a strategic exit within a 5–7 year horizon.

**Primary Exit:**
- Strategic acquisition by luxury hospitality groups, premium concierge platforms, or travel and payments companies
- Based on projected 2028 revenue of ~USD 9 million, a valuation range of 3–6× revenue is considered reasonable

**Secondary Options:**
- Minority stake sale to a strategic partner
- Growth-stage investment round with partial liquidity
